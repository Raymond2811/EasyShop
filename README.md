## Description
This app serves as a platform for exploring products and tags categorized for easy navigation, providing a user-friendly e-commerce experience. During the development process, I encountered a few challenges. The classwork really helped me finish this app. I ran into a challenge when my server and seed didn't want to work. Figured out I had to switch the user from localhost to 127.0.0.1 to get it running. Building this app, I feel like I got the hang of crafting request handlers, the pieces of code responsible for handling different types of requests, like retrieving product information or creating new entries in the database.
